## Overview

Traditional chat platforms often struggle with invasive contact requests, chaotic group threads, and scattered collaboration. Chattr addresses these issues by introducing:

- **Cipher Code Identity** – A unique identifier that eliminates phone/email dependence.  
- **Hives (Sub-Groups)** – Nested channels for focused conversations.  
- **Ephemeral Hives** – Temporary spaces that automatically archive once tasks or events end.  
- **Layered Collaboration** – Built-in tasks, pinned resources, integrated calendars, and real-time co-editing.  
- **Advanced Privacy** – End-to-end encryption, ephemeral chats, and granular permissions.
